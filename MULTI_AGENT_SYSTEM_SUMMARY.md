# Multi-Agent Script Parsing System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

We've successfully implemented a multi-agent script parsing system for your Rails application that uses AI agents to parse movie scripts and extract structured scene data. The system is built using the existing OpenAI integration and follows Rails best practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy
```
ScriptParserAgent (Main Coordinator)
├── SluglineExtractorAgent (Extracts scene headers)
├── SceneExtractorAgent (Extracts detailed scene data)
└── SceneVerifierAgent (Verifies completeness)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Script with PDF file or raw text
2. **Processing**: Multi-agent collaboration to extract structured data
3. **Output**: JSON data compatible with existing `ScriptJsonImporter`
4. **Storage**: Database insertion via existing ActiveRecord models

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Agent Classes
- `app/agents/application_agent.rb` - Base agent class with OpenAI integration
- `app/agents/slugline_extractor_agent.rb` - Extracts scene sluglines
- `app/agents/scene_extractor_agent.rb` - Extracts detailed scene data
- `app/agents/scene_verifier_agent.rb` - Verifies extraction completeness
- `app/agents/script_parser_agent.rb` - Main coordinator agent

### Job & Controller Integration
- `app/jobs/agentic_script_parser_job.rb` - ActiveJob for async processing
- `app/controllers/scripts_controller.rb` - Added `parse_with_agents` endpoint
- `config/routes.rb` - Added route for agentic parsing

### Configuration & Documentation
- `config/initializers/active_agent.rb` - Multi-agent system configuration
- `docs/AGENTIC_SCRIPT_PARSER.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `db/seeds/agentic_script_test.rb` - Test suite with sample script

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Scene Extraction**
- Automatically identifies scene sluglines (INT./EXT. headers)
- Extracts location, time, and scene metadata
- Parses dialogue and action beats chronologically

### 2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- **SluglineExtractorAgent**: Finds all scene headers in the script
- **SceneExtractorAgent**: Extracts detailed content for each scene
- **SceneVerifierAgent**: Ensures no scenes were missed
- **ScriptParserAgent**: Orchestrates the entire process

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- Retry logic for failed extractions (up to 3 attempts)
- JSON validation and error recovery
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when scenes fail

### 4. **Database Integration**
- Reuses existing `ScriptJsonImporter` for database insertion
- Compatible with existing models: `Scene`, `ActionBeat`, `Character`
- Maintains data integrity with transactions

### 5. **Async Processing**
- Background job processing via `AgenticScriptParserJob`
- Non-blocking API endpoint
- Scalable for large scripts

## 🚀 Usage

### API Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/v1/productions/:production_id/scripts/:id/parse_with_agents
```

### Programmatic Usage
```ruby
# Queue async parsing
AgenticScriptParserJob.perform_later(script_id)

# Direct synchronous parsing
parser_agent = ScriptParserAgent.new
success = parser_agent.parse_script(script_id)
```

### Testing
```ruby
# Run the test suite
require_relative 'db/seeds/agentic_script_test'
```

## 📊 Expected JSON Output

The system produces JSON compatible with your existing `ScriptJsonImporter`:

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "int_ext": "INT",
      "location": "COFFEE SHOP",
      "time": "DAY",
      "description": "Scene description...",
      "characters": ["SARAH", "DAVID"],
      "action_beats": [
        {
          "type": "action",
          "content": "Action description...",
          "characters": []
        },
        {
          "type": "dialogue",
          "content": "Character dialogue...",
          "characters": ["SARAH"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Agent Settings
- **Model**: GPT-4 (configurable)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (for consistent parsing)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (adjustable based on script length)
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts per scene

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Logging
All agents log their activities with prefixed class names:
```
[ScriptParserAgent] 🎬 Starting script parsing for Script#123
[SluglineExtractorAgent] Found 15 sluglines
[SceneExtractorAgent] ✅ Successfully extracted scene 1
[SceneVerifierAgent] ✅ Scene verification passed
```

### Error Tracking
- Failed scenes are logged with details
- JSON parsing errors are captured
- API failures are handled gracefully

## 🎯 Advantages Over Existing System

### 1. **Reasoning & Validation**
- AI agents can reason about script structure
- Built-in verification prevents missed scenes
- Self-correcting through retry logic

### 2. **Modularity**
- Each agent has a specific responsibility
- Easy to modify or extend individual agents
- Testable components

### 3. **Scalability**
- Async processing prevents timeouts
- Parallel processing potential
- Configurable resource usage

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging
- Well-documented codebase

## 🔄 Integration with Existing System

### Compatibility
- Uses existing `ScriptJsonImporter` for database insertion
- Compatible with current `Script`, `Scene`, `ActionBeat` models
- Doesn't interfere with existing `ParseScriptJob`

### Migration Strategy
- New system runs alongside existing parser
- Can be activated per script via API endpoint
- Easy rollback if needed

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Script Included
The test suite includes a complete sample script with:
- Multiple scenes (INT./EXT.)
- Character dialogue
- Action descriptions
- Proper scene transitions

### Test Coverage
- Individual agent testing
- Full workflow integration
- Error scenario handling
- Database insertion verification

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Test with sample script: `require_relative 'db/seeds/agentic_script_test'`
3. Try API endpoint with existing script

### Future Enhancements
- Parallel scene processing for speed
- Custom prompts per production
- Advanced character relationship extraction
- Integration with shot generation system

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Token Usage
- Efficient prompts minimize API costs
- Chunked processing for large scripts
- Configurable token limits

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in retry logic respects API limits
- Async processing prevents blocking
- Configurable delays between requests
