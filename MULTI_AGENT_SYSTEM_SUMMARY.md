# Multi-Agent Script Parsing System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

We've successfully implemented a multi-agent script parsing system for your Rails application that uses AI agents to parse movie scripts and extract structured scene data. The system is built using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 nano model and follows Rails best practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy
```
ScriptParserAgent (Main Coordinator)
├── SluglineExtractorAgent (Extracts scene headers)
├── SceneExtractorAgent (Extracts detailed scene data)
└── SceneVerifierAgent (Validates structure)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Script with PDF file or raw text
2. **Processing**: Multi-agent collaboration to extract structured data
3. **Output**: JSON data compatible with existing `ScriptJsonImporter`
4. **Storage**: Database insertion via existing ActiveRecord models

## 📁 Files Created & Modified

### Core Agent Classes
- `app/agents/application_agent.rb` - Base agent class with OpenAI integration
- `app/agents/slugline_extractor_agent.rb` - Extracts scene sluglines
- `app/agents/scene_extractor_agent.rb` - Extracts detailed scene data
- `app/agents/scene_verifier_agent.rb` - Validates extraction structure
- `app/agents/script_parser_agent.rb` - Main coordinator agent

### Job & Controller Integration
- `app/jobs/agentic_script_parser_job.rb` - ActiveJob for async processing
- Modified existing controllers to add `parse_with_agents` endpoint

### Testing & Documentation
- `db/seeds/agentic_script_test.rb` - Test suite for the multi-agent system

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **GPT-4.1 Nano Integration**
- Uses latest `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` model
- High token limit (32,768) allows processing entire scripts at once
- No chunking required - full script context maintained
- Optimized for accuracy and performance

### 2. **Intelligent Scene Extraction**
- Automatically identifies scene sluglines (INT./EXT. headers)
- Handles complex scene numbers (1, 2A, 2B, etc.)
- Processes CONT'D and CONTINUED scenes properly
- Extracts location, time, and scene metadata
- Parses dialogue and action beats chronologically

### 3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- **SluglineExtractorAgent**: Finds all scene headers in the entire script
- **SceneExtractorAgent**: Extracts detailed content for each scene
- **SceneVerifierAgent**: Performs structural validation of extracted data
- **ScriptParserAgent**: Orchestrates the entire process

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- Retry logic for failed extractions (up to 3 attempts)
- JSON validation and error recovery
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when scenes fail
- Fallback regex extraction for sluglines

### 5. **Structural Validation**
- Basic validation instead of complex AI verification
- Checks required fields (scene_number, int_ext, location, time)
- Validates data types and formats
- Identifies duplicate scene numbers
- Warns about potential issues without blocking

### 6. **Database Integration**
- Reuses existing `ScriptJsonImporter` for database insertion
- Compatible with existing models: `Scene`, `ActionBeat`, `Character`
- Maintains data integrity with transactions

### 7. **Async Processing**
- Background job processing via `AgenticScriptParserJob`
- Non-blocking API endpoint
- Scalable for large scripts

## 🚀 Usage

### API Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/v1/productions/:production_id/scripts/:id/parse_with_agents
```

### Programmatic Usage
```ruby
# Queue async parsing
AgenticScriptParserJob.perform_later(script_id, script_parse_id)

# Direct synchronous parsing
parser_agent = ScriptParserAgent.new
success = parser_agent.parse_script(script_id)
```

### Testing
```ruby
# Run the test suite
require_relative 'db/seeds/agentic_script_test'
```

## 📊 Expected JSON Output

The system produces JSON compatible with your existing `ScriptJsonImporter`:

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": "1",
      "int_ext": "INT",
      "location": "COFFEE SHOP",
      "time": "DAY",
      "description": "A busy coffee shop scene with morning rush",
      "characters": ["SARAH", "DAVID"],
      "action_beats": [
        {
          "type": "action",
          "content": "Sarah enters the crowded coffee shop",
          "characters": ["SARAH"]
        },
        {
          "type": "dialogue",
          "content": "I'll have a large coffee, please.",
          "characters": ["SARAH"]
        }
      ],
      "original_slugline": "1. INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Agent Settings
- **Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14`
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (for consistent parsing)
- **Max Tokens**: 32,768 (handles large scripts)
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts per scene

## 🔍 Enhanced Scene Number Handling

The system now handles complex scene numbering:
- Standard numbers: `1`, `2`, `3`
- Letter suffixes: `1A`, `1B`, `2A`, `2B`
- Roman numerals: `I`, `II`, `III`
- Continued scenes: `1 CONT'D`, `2 (CONTINUED)`

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Logging
All agents log their activities with prefixed class names:
```
[ScriptParserAgent] 🎬 Starting script parsing for Script#123
[SluglineExtractorAgent] Found 24 sluglines (no chunking used)
[SceneExtractorAgent] ✅ Successfully extracted scene 1
[SceneVerifierAgent] Structural validation complete: PASSED
```

### Error Tracking
- Failed scenes are logged with details
- JSON parsing errors are captured
- API failures are handled gracefully
- Structural validation warnings logged

## 🎯 Advantages Over Previous Implementation
